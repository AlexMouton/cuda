The CUDA library provides a direct, general purpose C-like SPMD programming
model for NVIDIA graphics cards (G8x series onwards). This is a collection of
bindings to allow you to call and control, although not write, such functions
from Haskell-land. You will need to install the CUDA driver and developer
toolkit.

The configure step will look for your CUDA installation in the standard places,
and if the `nvcc` compiler is found in your `PATH`, relative to that.
