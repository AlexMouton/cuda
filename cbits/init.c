/*
 * GHC-8 introduced a new (simpler) 64-bit allocator, which on startup 'mmap's
 * 1TB of address space and then commits sub-portions of that memory as needed.
 *
 * The CUDA driver also appears to 'mmap' a large chunk of address space on
 * 'cuInit', probably as the arena for shuffling memory to and from the device,
 * but attempts to do so at a _fixed_ address. If the GHC RTS has already taken
 * that address at the time we call 'cuInit', driver initialisation will fail
 * with an "out of memory" error.
 *
 * One workaround is to call 'cuInit' before initialising the RTS. Then the
 * RTS's allocation will avoid CUDA's allocation, since the RTS doesn't care
 * where in the address space it gets that memory. Embedding the following
 * __attribute__((constructor)) function in the library does the trick nicely,
 * and the linker will ensure that this gets executed when the shared library is
 * loaded (during program startup).
 *
 * However, this forces us to initialise the CUDA driver even if we would never
 * have used it, and precludes setting custom initialisation options (even
 * though the option flags to 'cuInit' are currently ignored). Instead, we
 * simply reserve the memory region that 'cuInit' requires in the constructor
 * function so that the RTS avoids it, and override the 'cuInit' symbol with our
 * own version that releases that region before calling the original 'cuInit'.
 * The disadvantage of course is that this is a little fragile, since the CUDA
 * driver is closed and we don't know exactly which regions to reserve.
 *
 * See: https://github.com/tmcdonell/cuda/issues/39
