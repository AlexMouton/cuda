-- /Determining Registers Per Thread and Shared Memory Per Block/
--
-- To determine the number of registers used per thread in your kernel, simply
-- compile the kernel code using the option
--
-- > --ptxas-options=-v
--
-- to nvcc.  This will output information about register, local memory, shared
-- memory, and constant memory usage for each kernel in the @.cu@ file.
-- Alternatively, you can compile with the @-cubin@ option to nvcc.  This will
-- generate a @.cubin@ file, which you can open in a text editor.  Look for the
-- @code@ section with your kernel's name.  Within the curly braces (@{ ... }@)
-- for that code block, you will see a line with @reg = X@, where @x@ is the
-- number of registers used by your kernel.  You can also see the amount of
-- shared memory used as @smem = Y@.  However, if your kernel declares any
-- external shared memory that is allocated dynamically, you will need to add
-- the number in the @.cubin@ file to the amount you dynamically allocate at run
-- time to get the correct shared memory usage.
--
-- /Notes About Occupancy/
--
-- Higher occupancy does not necessarily mean higher performance.  If a kernel
-- is not bandwidth bound, then increasing occupancy will not necessarily
-- increase performance.  If a kernel invocation is already running at least one
-- thread block per multiprocessor in the GPU, and it is bottlenecked by
-- computation and not by global memory accesses, then increasing occupancy may
-- have no effect.  In fact, making changes just to increase occupancy can have
-- other effects, such as additional instructions, spills to local memory (which
-- is off chip), divergent branches, etc.  As with any optimization, you should
-- experiment to see how changes affect the *wall clock time* of the kernel
-- execution.  For bandwidth bound applications, on the other hand, increasing
-- occupancy can help better hide the latency of memory accesses, and therefore
-- improve performance.
